A Chrome Extension for OCR Text Extraction and ChatGPT Integration

The goal of this project is to create a Chrome extension that enables users to take screenshots of selected sections on a webpage, including images and text, and use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text from the screenshot. The extracted text will be fed into the ChatGPT via OpenAI/self-hosting model's API, allowing users to interact with the AI using different prompts through buttons or a text box on the extension's popup.
